Prompt A — Electric Blue (principal, 4K, Figma mockup):
UI/UX design concept for a modern web application in dark mode. Minimalist, ultra-clean Figma mockup style, straight-on orthographic view. Very large, prominent text input fields with big, highly readable fonts, generous spacing and padding. Below inputs, large rounded primary buttons with subtle gradients or soft glow indicating interactivity. Deep charcoal and soft black background, high-contrast off-white text, vibrant electric blue (#1E90FF) as primary accent, subtle emerald secondary accent. Flat layout with soft drop shadows, precise grid alignment, realistic UI details (placeholders, subtle focus state). Typography: modern sans (Inter / SF Pro) with large line-height. Composition centered, breathing room around controls, photorealistic UI lighting, Dribbble/Figma presentation, 3840x2160.

Prompt B — Emerald Accent (elegante, 4K):
Dark-mode web form mockup emphasizing large writing areas: oversized multi-line text fields, very large caret-friendly font size, visible padding and generous line spacing. Prominent, rounded CTA buttons beneath each field with clear labels and soft emerald green (#00C389) accent. Color palette: deep charcoal blacks, off-white text, subtle secondary electric blue highlights. Minimal chrome, no background clutter. Figma-style, orthographic, high-fidelity vector look, soft ambient lighting, 3840x2160.

Prompt C — High‑Contrast Orange (alternativa vibrante, 4K):
High-end UI mockup, minimalist dark theme with luxurious spacing. Large inputs presented as card-like panels with subtle inner shadow, oversized readable typography, bold rounded buttons with slight glassy gradient and neon orange accent (#FF7A00) for primary actions. Emphasize hierarchy, accessibility and tactile affordances. Crisp vector look, Figma/Dribbble trend, centered composition, 3840x2160.

Negativas (incluir em campo 'negative prompt' se suportado):
no logos, no text overlays, no watermarks, no people, no photo backgrounds, no grain, no low-resolution artifacts, no extra UI chrome, no busy textures.

Parâmetros recomendados:
- Resolution / Aspect: 3840x2160 (16:9)
- Steps: 30–60; Guidance / CFG: 6–12 (aumentar para mais fidelidade)
- Camera: orthographic / straight-on
- Style tags: Figma, Dribbble, UI mockup, ultra-clean typography, Inter, SF Pro
- Notes: gerar em PNG 4k para revisão; gerar variantes de cor (A/B) para comparação.

Usage notes:
- Se quiser variações de cor, troque o hex do accent em cada prompt.
- Para Midjourney: adapte tags e use aspect ratio `--ar 16:9` e `--v 5` (ou o que preferir).
- Para Stable Diffusion / img2img: use the prompt as "positive" and add the negatives to the negative prompt field; set size to 3840x2160 if supported or generate 1920x1080 and upscale.

Prompt D — Ultra-clean photorealistic Figma mockup (user refined, 4K):
Ultra-clean UI/UX design concept for a modern web application in dark mode, presented as a photorealistic Figma mockup. Straight-on orthographic view. The composition is centered on a deep charcoal and soft black background. Features very large, prominent text input fields with generous internal padding and massive, highly readable off-white sans-serif typography (Inter/SF Pro style) showing placeholders like "Enter your headline" and "Type your message here...". Below these inputs are huge, rounded primary action buttons with a vibrant electric blue (#1E90FF) subtle gradient and soft glow indicating interactivity. Flat layout architecture with precisely aligned grids, soft diffuse drop shadows under elements providing depth, and realistic UI lighting. Subtle emerald green secondary accent elements occasionally visible. No clutter, luxurious breathing room around all controls. 4K resolution, detailed vector rendering.

Generator notes / quick commands:
- Midjourney (copy/paste):
	"Ultra-clean UI/UX design concept for a modern web application in dark mode, photorealistic Figma mockup, straight-on orthographic view, deep charcoal background, very large prominent text input fields with placeholders 'Enter your headline' and 'Type your message here...', huge rounded primary buttons with electric blue #1E90FF gradient and soft glow, precise grid, soft drop shadows, realistic UI lighting, Inter/SF Pro typography, 4k" --ar 16:9 --v 5

- Stable Diffusion / AUTOMATIC1111 (positive / negative):
	Positive: Ultra-clean UI/UX design concept for a modern web application in dark mode, photorealistic Figma mockup, straight-on orthographic view, deep charcoal background, very large prominent text input fields with placeholders "Enter your headline" and "Type your message here...", huge rounded primary buttons with electric blue #1E90FF gradient and soft glow, precise grid alignment, soft drop shadows, realistic UI lighting, Inter/SF Pro typography, high detail, 4k
	Negative: no logos, no text overlays, no watermarks, no people, no photo backgrounds, no grain, no low-resolution artifacts, no extra UI chrome, no busy textures

- Gemini Image / Google (if using an API): send the prompt text in the request body with resolution 3840x2160, specify orthographic/camera params if supported, include negative instructions in the safety/negative fields where possible.

Notes: If the generator does not support 3840x2160 natively, render at 1920x1080 with high fidelity and then upscale using a dedicated upscaler or Gigapixel-style tool.

Color & Layout Variations (copy-paste the full prompt and change accents/layout tags as needed)

Variant set — Accent color swaps:
- Variant A1 — Electric Blue (default): primary accent #1E90FF (use Prompt A or D unchanged).
- Variant A2 — Emerald: replace primary accent with #00C389 (use for a calmer, professional look).
- Variant A3 — Neon Orange: replace primary accent with #FF7A00 (for higher contrast/energy).

Variant set — Layout focus options:
- Layout L1 — Large Input Focus: emphasize oversized multi-line fields, center composition, add "focus on very large multi-line inputs" to the prompt. Use for writing-first UIs.
- Layout L2 — Compact Card Grid: present inputs as a two-column card grid for desktop (add "two-column card grid layout with compact cards" to prompt). Useful for dashboards.
- Layout L3 — Minimal Hero Form: single-column centered hero with huge headline input and one CTA (add "hero single-column layout, large headline input, single prominent CTA").

How to combine (examples):
- Electric Blue + Large Input: start from Prompt D and append "Accent: #1E90FF; Layout: Large Input Focus" or edit the text to say "very large multi-line input fields (Large Input Focus) with electric blue #1E90FF accent".
- Emerald + Compact Grid: use Prompt B and add "two-column compact card grid layout; primary accent #00C389".

Quick copy examples (one-line ready-to-send):
- Electric Blue / Large Input:
	"Ultra-clean UI/UX design concept ... very large multi-line input fields (Large Input Focus), primary accent #1E90FF, deep charcoal background, 4k"
- Emerald / Compact Grid:
	"Dark-mode web form mockup ... two-column card grid layout (Compact Grid), primary accent #00C389, deep charcoal background, 4k"

Tips:
- When testing, render 2–3 variants (e.g., A1-L1, A2-L1, A2-L2) to compare composition and color.
- If the generator supports seed or style-mixing, keep seed constant across color variants to compare only color/layout differences.
